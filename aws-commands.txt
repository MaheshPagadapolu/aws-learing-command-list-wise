Hello my name is Mahesh
We are learning new things

					What is Git
1)Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files and coordinate work on projects among multiple people.
2)Version Control: Git tracks changes to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and see who made specific modifications.
3)Branching and Merging: Git allows easy branching, where developers can create independent lines of development, and later merge changes back into the main codebase.
4)It is basically mostly user for the version updates information completely.

					Basic Commands:
git status: Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area (e.g., which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, etc.).

git init: Initializes a new Git repository.

git add [file name]: Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for a commit. You can use git add . to stage all changes.

git commit: Records changes to the repository.

git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.

git log: Displays the commit history of the repository.

git remote add origin main: Manages remote repository connections.

git diff: Shows differences between changes in your working directory and the last commit or between branches.

git reset [commit]: Moves the current branch to the specified commit, optionally resetting the working directory and index.

                                     Common Git Commands:

git clone [url]: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

git pull: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to a local one.

git branch: Lists branches or creates a new one.

git merge: Combines changes from different branches.

				Branching and Merging:

git checkout [branch]: Switches to the specified branch. You can also use it to check out specific files.
git branch [branch-name]: Creates a new branch.
git branch -d [branch-name]: Deletes a branch.
git merge [branch]: Merges another branch into the current branch.
git rebase [branch]: Reapplies commits on top of another base commit (used for cleaner commit history).

				Working with Remote Repositories:

git fetch: Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into your working directory.
git pull: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository (combines git fetch and git merge).
git push [remote] [branch]: Pushes your commits to the remote repository.


			Difference between Git & GitHub
1) Git is an application/ Software but GitHub is an website.
2)Git is local system GitHub is cloud based system.
3)Git is an version control in a local system but GitHub is used to store git repository through online.
4)GitHub is very useful to access the changes which are made by the Git in other systems but the local system must have the Git.
