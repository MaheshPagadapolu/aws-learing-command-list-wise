					What is Git
1)Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files and coordinate work on projects among multiple people.
2)Version Control: Git tracks changes to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and see who made specific modifications.
3)Branching and Merging: Git allows easy branching, where developers can create independent lines of development, and later merge changes back into the main codebase.

					Basic Commands:
git status: Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area (e.g., which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, etc.).
git add [file_name]: Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for a commit. You can use git add . to stage all changes.
git log: Displays the commit history of the repository.
git diff: Shows differences between changes in your working directory and the last commit or between branches.
git reset [commit]: Moves the current branch to the specified commit, optionally resetting the working directory and index.

                                     Common Git Commands:
git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git clone [url]: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
git commit: Records changes to the repository.
git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to a local one.
git branch: Lists branches or creates a new one.
git merge: Combines changes from different branches.

				Branching and Merging:
git checkout [branch]: Switches to the specified branch. You can also use it to check out specific files.
git branch [branch-name]: Creates a new branch.
git branch -d [branch-name]: Deletes a branch.
git merge [branch]: Merges another branch into the current branch.
git rebase [branch]: Reapplies commits on top of another base commit (used for cleaner commit history).

				Working with Remote Repositories:

git remote: Manages remote repository connections.
git fetch: Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into your working directory.
git pull: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository (combines git fetch and git merge).
git push [remote] [branch]: Pushes your commits to the remote repository.
